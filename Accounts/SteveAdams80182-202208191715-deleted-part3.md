People in France, Germany, etc have no choice but cram in together. You can live like a serf in Paris, or a king in Dallas, for the same monthly rent. <!--1329884591461568512-->

Can't have any of that! https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/undoing-the-harm-of-californias-teacher-tenure/2016/07/13/ec56dd90-484b-11e6-bdb9-701687974517_story.html <!--1329882611427078145-->

Buses roll empty most of the time. Massive subsidies are required to get people to ride, and this creates a world of 3 hour nightmare commutes. The math just doesn't add up in a country with land. <!--1329867511911759872-->

Silicon Valley is mostly single family homes, for example. And I don't have to tell people, they're voting with their feet. Note the size of Paris or Manhattan compared to 100 years ago. Meanwhile, the Dallas area adds 100k ppl/yr. <!--1329865463141056512-->

They do that in Hong Kong, because they have no choice. We have a choice. <!--1329858165114957824-->

And you might want to reread my post - I said an Uber-like service run by public transit (always awesome!) not those meanies at Uber and Lyft. <!--1329853084600680448-->

When I'm getting a $5 check in the mail for every $1 I spend driving, I'll let you know. Until then, you're welcome to entertain the fantasy that $ used to maintain roads (used by all) in the BA is in any way comparable to the billions in public transit subsidies here. <!--1329814534895271939-->

I pay $.50/gallon gas tax, vehicle registration taxes, etc. And Muni buses enjoy the same roads I do. Public transport?
