I can only imagine the crowd of incel trolls that would show up. We might even get a Supe or two (see below)! I'm sure I'll bump into you sometime though.

Whether you call 911 or 311 about a homeless issue, they tell you to call the police non-emergency number, 553-0123. So who exactly do we call with homeless issues? <!--1544821734901043200-->

I use both, and figure we can all share the road, with a little understanding. Comparing the US to Holland, which is so land starved they had to dig half their country out of the sea, is absurd. We've got room for all. <!--1539830260866220032-->

And of course there are far more car drivers than bike commuters. <!--1539826408045785088-->

Even in places where they don't, you're talking a 1-2 cent per mile subsidy, vs a $1-10/mile subsidy for public transit. <!--1539783734060208128-->

We clean them up, give them a place to live and a simple job...and they show up for work. The problem is, that's never ever going to happen, based on my experience. They won't show up for that job. <!--1539776964126314497-->

To some extent I really don't care (about the adults) - if you drifted here to ruin my neighborhood, expect criticism. <!--1539761077310742528-->

Seems bizarre, until you realize that Honey/Haney only serve one master, the construction industry, & problems that can't be solved by funneling money their way don't exist.

Your voters aren't that dumb Alex. <!--1539632716492046341-->

You get a monthly employer allowance, a tax break on the rest...that's what makes public transport so suspicious - nobody would pay for it, if they really had to pay for it. <!--1539630749246038021-->

Or maybe it's $20 - I need to do an analysis when I have time. It's far more than you pay though. For Catrain, I estimated $80/ride per person per ride. https://eyeonsf.com/2020/12/12/77-miles-of-track/ <!--1539629187832500227-->
